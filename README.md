Lebanese-Diet-Website
=====================

A website written in ASP.net which contains a database of Lebanese food and suggests healthy food combinations based on calorie count


Description
------------

This website was developed by my project team and me for my Database Management Systems Course. It contains information about different Lebanese food
ingredients such as calorie count, as well as different lebanese dishes made from those ingredients. The user can browse through the data in both arabic 
and english, and see the information about each dish. The user can also insert a calorie value, and he would be presented with suggestions of meals 
and dishes relative to the value he entered.

The code files used to write this project are included, however, the website cannot be opened due to lack of database and other configurations.
